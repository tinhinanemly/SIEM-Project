# SIEM-Project
Custom SIEM lab using ELK stack, Filebeat, and Python log generator
# SIEM Project with ELK Stack  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a **basic SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** system using the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Filebeat, Kibana)**.  

- A **Python log generator** creates simulated security events.  
- Logs are shipped to **Elasticsearch** using **Filebeat**.  
- In **Kibana**, I created **detection rules** and **dashboards** to visualize alerts and security trends.

## 🛠️ Features  
- Custom **Python Security Log Generator**  
- Logs shipped with **Filebeat**  
- Indexed and stored in **Elasticsearch**  
- Detection rules for suspicious activities  
- **Dashboards** in Kibana for log visualization and alerts  
- Alerts triggered when rules are matched
